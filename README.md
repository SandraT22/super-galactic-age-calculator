The second form will take in the users lifestyle, activity level, eating habits, and their choice of one of the previously mentioned planets. Once their input is submited the second form will tell the user what their life expectancy is and what their life expectancy on their chosen planet is. The third form takes in user input of thei age on their chosen planet and their life expectancy on that planet and return how many years they have left to live on that planet. If they have lived past the life expectancy on that planet the form will also return to they the years that they have gone over their life expectancy.
